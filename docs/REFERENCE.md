# Integration reference

Start with the [developer guide](DEVELOPERS.md) for a complete first setting.
Examples below are fragments unless they include a full file. `settingsManifest`
means an INI string; replace example paths with absolute paths on the game host.

## Menu pages

ModCoreSettings is the only DMM integration. Other mods never install a DMM
extension or call DMM directly; to add generated menu pages they publish data
through `Scripts/vendor/menu_contributions.lua`. A provider is the mod/page that owns
a settings model. Copy that file unchanged into your mod's `Scripts/vendor` folder,
add the folder to `package.path`, and publish from the ordinary mod state:

```lua
local Menu=require('menu_contributions')
local pages=Menu.publisher(ModRef,{id='ExampleMod',directory='<absolute writable folder>'})
pages:publish({pages={
    {id='ExampleMod',name='Example',attach='ExampleMod'},
    {id='ExampleMod.speed',name='Speed',under='ExampleMod',
        manifest=settingsManifest,configDirectory='<absolute folder for ConfigFile>'},
}})
-- pages:withdraw() removes them; Menu.validate(id,{pages=...}) checks offline.
```

Page fields: `id` (the contributor id or `<id>.*`; it is the `providerId` in Apply
notifications), `name`, optional `author`, `version`, `description`, `visible`,
settings as [`menu` data](#menu-data) (preferred) or a `manifest`, either with
`configDirectory`, and at most one of `under` (an earlier page of the same
contributor) or `attach` (a mod folder name). `link` makes a
[slot link](#slot-rows) entry. `group='module'` lists the page on the ModCore
page's Modules tab; a mod whose `mod.json` sets `"group": "ModCore"` is listed
there without it. `group='tool'` lists the page only on the ModCore page's
Developer Tools tab, which opens it; the mod list does not show it. A tool page
needs settings, as any page DMM opens does.

Placement on every menu build:

- `under`: after the parent and its earlier children, indented.
- `attach`: matched case-insensitively against a mod's name, id or detected
  folder. A detected placeholder without settings is hidden while the page is
  shown, and the page becomes that mod's entry: its name, author, version, icon
  and description come from the folder's `mod.json`, as the placeholder's would,
  and the page's own are only fallbacks. So a page that holds another mod's
  settings shows as that mod. Otherwise the page follows that mod, indented,
  unless it is a module group page. A name matching several mods rejects the
  contributor. A page with `visible=false` still hides its detected placeholder.
- Otherwise: sorted by name with other mods, so a page that returns does not move.

Contributed pages need no `mod_settings.ini` on disk; ModCoreSettings keeps
their manifest in memory and only uses `configDirectory` to resolve `ConfigFile`.

Publishing writes a new generation of files and then switches the contributor's
shared variable; the menu keeps showing the previous generation until then.
`publish` rejects structurally invalid pages. Menu data and manifests are checked
when the menu builds; any failure (menu data, manifest, id collision, ambiguous
`attach`) skips that contributor's pages and is logged once. The rest of the menu
is unaffected.

### Menu data

A page's `menu` describes its settings without DMM's manifest format;
ModCoreSettings builds the page from it on every menu build. It is plain data:
strings, finite numbers, booleans and tables.

```lua
menu={
    storage={file='config.ini',section='Settings'},   -- optional
    groups={
        {id='Layout',label='Layout'},
        {id='Advanced',heading=false,visible={field='Style',values={1}}},
    },
    fields={
        {id='Style',group='Layout',label='Style',default=0,tabs=true,
            choices={{value=0,label='Swap'},{value=1,label='Stack',note='Two rows'}}},
        {id='Size',group='Layout',label='Size',default=100,range={min=10,max=200,step=5,suffix='%'},
            relabel={field='Style',values={[1]='Stack size'}}},
        {id='Gap',group='Advanced',label='Gap',default=4,range={min=0,max=20}},
    },
}
```

- `storage`: values are saved under `section` in `file`, relative to the page's
  `configDirectory`. Without it, DMM's default storage applies.
- Groups keep their order; only groups with fields are shown. A group's heading is
  its `label`, else its `id`; `heading=false` hides it; `level` (0–6) sets its size.
- A field has `choices` (a picker; up to 64) or a whole-number `range`, and a
  `default` among them. One choice makes a button or, `readOnly`, a shown value.
  `tabs=true` shows up to eight choices side by side.
- `level` 1 puts a picker in the page's title row (one per page); 0 and 2–6 set
  the label size.
- `visible={field=,values={...}}` shows a field or group only while that picker
  on the page holds one of the values. `relabel={field=,values={[value]='text'}}`
  names it after that picker's value.
- A choice's `note` is shown small under it. `module='<mod folder>'` notes that
  mod's name, as the mod browser shows it.
- `action=true` makes a navigation row (never stored; see [page hooks](#page-hooks));
  `link='<page id>'` or `'<provider>:<slot>'` opens that page.
- Ids are letters, digits and `_ . : -`; text has no `| ; [ ]` or control
  characters. Invalid data names the offending id.

A page with `menu` needs descriptor contract 4; ModCoreSettings builds that
predate it skip the whole contribution.

### Slot rows

A page can reserve a place for another mod's settings. Mark a read-only row as
the slot:

```ini
[Setting.MCC_Visuals_Pending]
Id=MCC_Visuals_Pending
Type=picker
Label=Quickslot templates
Group=Visuals
PresetValues=0|1
PresetLabels=Coming soon|Coming soon
mcReadOnly=1
mcSlot=visuals
```

Slot names are letters, digits and `_`, at most 64 characters, unique per page.
The page needs explicit `Id`s on every setting. Contributors address a slot as
`<provider id>:<slot>`; a `ModCore<Name>` provider may also be written as its
lowercase `<name>`, so `controls:visuals` and `ModCoreControls:visuals` are the
same slot. A contributor publishes settings from one of its own manifest pages
(which may be `visible=false`):

```lua
pages:publish({pages={...},rows={
    {page='ModCoreTemplates',slot='controls:visuals',settings={'MCT_Template','MCT_RingSize'}},
}})
```

When the page loads, the listed settings replace the slot row in place, in
contributor and list order. Each takes the slot's `Group`, so the group's
Category rule gates it. A row carries its own `VisibleWhen`/`VisibleValues`
only when they name a row the same contributor inserted earlier in that slot.
DMM ANDs that rule with the Category rule. A row without its own rule takes the
slot row's rule; a slot row with its own `VisibleWhen` rejects rows that bring
one. Source Category rules are not carried. Only core DMM fields are copied, so
inserted rows render as plain pickers, toggles or sliders. The exception is a
row label rule (`mcLabelWhen`/`mcLabels`): it is copied when `mcLabelWhen` names
a row the same contributor inserted earlier, and the row is skipped otherwise. A
row named by `mcSlotLabel=1` keeps no label rule. A picker's `mcChoiceNotes` is
also copied. Presets, navigation,
read-only and link rows cannot be inserted. With no valid rows the slot row
shows unchanged. Each `rows` entry is all or nothing: one invalid setting skips
that entry, logged as `SLOT_ROW_SKIPPED`, and other entries still insert.

Add `mcSlotLabel=1` to the slot row to let the host name the slot. The first
inserted row then takes the slot row's `Label`, `mcLevel` and `mcCategory`;
later rows keep their own. To make that row stand in for the group heading,
suppress the heading with `mcHeading=0` on the group's Category and give the
slot row `mcCategory=1`:

```ini
[Category.Visuals]
VisibleWhen=MCC_Page
VisibleValues=1
mcHeading=0

[Setting.MCC_Visuals_Pending]
...
Label=Quickslots Visuals
mcCategory=1
mcReadOnly=1
mcSlot=visuals
mcSlotLabel=1
```

Filled, the page shows one `Quickslots Visuals` row whose value side is the
contributed picker; with no rows, the placeholder shows under the same label.
The row stays the source's setting: storage, Apply and visibility are unchanged.
`mcHeading` itself is not transferred; a page has at most one level-one heading.

The page's model sees only its own settings: its configuration, initialization
and Apply event never include inserted rows. Inserted rows edit the source
page's model. The page's Apply commits its own settings first, then each
dirtied source, which publishes its Apply event under the source page id. A
source fails only its own commit; the host's event is still published. Restore,
Reset and the unapplied-changes guard cover both. A source whose model cannot
open leaves its rows inert. As on any page, unapplied changes are discarded
when the page closes, so the same setting on two pages never holds two pending
values.

A `visible=false` page that is a row source shows as an ordinary page, in its
declared place (`under`, `attach`), when none of its rows has an available
slot: the host page is not listed or does not declare the slot. Its rows then
work as on any page, with the same page id and storage. Build such a page to
stand alone. Availability is decided per menu build; a row entry rejected
later, while the page loads, does not bring the fallback back.

A page with `link='<provider>:<slot>'` and no manifest is a browser entry for
that slot. Selecting it opens the slot's page and sets the navigation pickers
that gate the slot so its rows show; navigation never marks the page dirty.
The entry is listed only while the host page declares the slot and the slot
has rows. Otherwise it is hidden like `visible=false`, including any detected
placeholder it claims. Link pages cannot have children.

Rows and links need descriptor contract 2, so a ModCoreSettings build that predates
slots skips the whole contribution, pages included.

### Page hooks

A page whose settings change at runtime, or that owns its own storage, names a
hooks file instead of menu data or a manifest. ModCoreSettings loads it in its own menu
state, once per session, and modules beside it can be `require`d. Every hooks
folder shares DMM's module search path, and the first module loaded under a name
wins, so give helper modules names unique to your mod (MCC's use `mc_`):

```lua
{id='ExampleMod',name='Example',attach='ExampleMod',
    hooks='<absolute path>/Scripts/mcs_page.lua',configDirectory='<absolute folder>'}
```

```lua
-- mcs_page.lua
return {contract=1,
    menu=function(context) return menuData end,                        -- every menu build
    -- or manifest=function(context) return settingsManifest end,
    load=function(context) return {[settingId]=value} end,             -- optional
    apply=function(context,values,changes) return saved,warning end,   -- with load
    action=function(context,id,value,values) end,                      -- optional
}
```

`action` runs whenever a navigation row (`mcNavigation=1`, not a page link) is
set, even to its current value. A navigation tab row whose choices share one label,
such as `PresetLabels=Play|Play` with `mcType=tab`, shows a single button that runs
it on each press. `id` and `value` are that row's; `values` holds every row's
current value by id, navigation rows included. An error is logged as
`HOOK_ACTION_FAILED` (ERROR) and the page carries on.

`menu` returns [menu data](#menu-data), `manifest` a settings manifest; a hooks
file has one of them. Both get `context.moduleName(folder)`, a mod folder's name
as the mod browser shows it.

`context` is `{page=<page id>,directory=<configDirectory>}`. With `load` and
`apply`, ModCoreSettings never reads or writes the page's config file: `load`
supplies the values (missing ids keep their defaults; a value the setting cannot
hold also keeps its default, is logged as `HOOK_VALUES_SKIPPED`, and is replaced
on the next Apply; keybinds are accepted in any form the editor normalizes), and Apply passes every
value by id and the edited ones as `{old=,new=}`. `apply` returns the values it
saved, which become committed and are published in the Apply notification, plus
an optional warning. An error from `apply` rejects the Apply and keeps the page
dirty; an error from `load` shows the page error. An error loading the file or
from `manifest` skips the contributor like any other failure. Hooks pages need
descriptor contract 3, which older ModCoreSettings builds skip.

### Page links

A navigation picker with `mcLinkPage=<page id>` opens that page instead of saving
a value. It requires `mcNavigation=1` and works in any manifest. With unapplied
changes the link is refused and the page shows a status message.
`mcLinkPage=<provider>:<slot>` opens the page that hosts that slot, sets its
navigation pickers so the slot shows, and selects the slot's first row. With
`mcType=tab`, a link shows one button labelled with its first choice. `mcLevel=5`
sets the row label in small (12pt) muted text, which suits a notice.

## Apply notifications

`Scripts/vendor/settings_api.lua` is ModCoreSettings's versioned, game-agnostic consumer API.
A mod may copy that file unchanged into its own `Scripts/vendor` folder and subscribe to its
own DMM provider ID:

```lua
local Settings=require('settings_api')
local unsubscribe=Settings.subscribe('ExampleMod',function(event)
    -- event.providerId, event.revision, event.values and event.changes
end)
```

DMM publishes only after a successful, durable Apply. Delivery is event-driven;
there is no file watcher or polling. Revisions are delivered at most once in a
Lua state. There is one active callback per provider ID; subscribing again through
the same client replaces it. Another Lua state cannot claim that provider ID.
Existing revisions are not replayed at subscription time: load startup values
from your config. Unsubscribing stops delivery but does not release the native
handler/claim; fully restart after script reloads. `values` contains the applied numeric settings (text keybinds are omitted), and
`changes` contains `{old=...,new=...}` only for changed IDs. Treat the event and
its nested tables as read-only. Reload your config to read text bindings; the
event is not their value transport. A page with no numeric stored values emits
no Apply notification through this API; its storage hook needs a separate
post-save notification for gameplay consumers.
Callback failure cannot turn a completed save
into an Apply failure. Calling the returned function stops delivery to that
callback.

## Presentation metadata

`mcType=tab` renders an ordinary picker as outlined, right-aligned choices
with a 24-pixel right inset on the same row as its label. Choices sit 4 pixels
apart; the selected choice's outline is drawn at full strength. It supports up to eight
choices and retains DMM's keyboard/controller navigation, pending model and
Apply/Restore behavior. A single choice suits a read-only row.

`mcReferenceLabel=<text>` on an `mcReadOnly=1`, `mcType=tab` picker adds a
disabled button showing that text to the left of its choices, which then take
150 pixels.

`mcType=cycle` renders a picker as one button showing only the current choice at
13pt; a click moves to the next choice, wrapping. The button is as wide as the
keybind editor's key box and sits in its key column, so it lines up under keys.
DMM's keyboard/controller navigation is retained.

`mcWrap=1` on an `mcReadOnly=1` picker shows its value as 13pt left-aligned
text in a wider column, broken after commas so no line reaches 34 characters;
the row grows to fit its lines.

`mcPlayerExists=1` on a setting or `[Category.*]` shows it only while a player is in
the world (a player controller possessing a pawn); `mcPlayerExists=0` only while
none is, as in the main menu. It works like a hidden Yes|No picker that follows the
player, combined with any `VisibleWhen`, so a row keeps its own rule; rows whose
`VisibleWhen` source it hides are hidden too. The check runs whenever DMM checks
visibility: on opening the page and on each change. Pages without it never check.

`mcSilent=1` on a setting or `[Category.*]` keeps DMM's interface sounds (hover,
select, change) off its rows, as on rows that play sounds of their own.

`mcDimValues=<value>|<value>` on a picker fades the whole row, label and value,
to 45% opacity while its own value is one of those listed, the opacity of a
disabled choice. Each value must be one of the picker's `PresetValues`. It is
presentation only: the row stays enabled and its value saves as usual.

`mcText=<source>` on an `mcReadOnly=1` picker replaces the row with a 360-pixel
scrollable text area showing a text source the host provides, newest line at the
bottom. While the row shows, the source is checked about once a second; new text
scrolls the area to its end. An unknown source shows "Unavailable." The ModCore
page's Errors tab uses the `errors` source: the latest 100 error lines of
`UE4SS.log` (ModCore `ERROR`/`CRITICAL` messages, failed Lua calls, and lines
mentioning an error, exception or stack traceback, with their stack traces).

`mcTable=<code>:<text>|<code>:<text>|...` on an `mcReadOnly=1` picker replaces the
row with a static table of pairs, such as `2192:→|25CF:●`. `mcColumns=<n>` (1–6,
default 1) sets the columns, filled top to bottom. Codes are 12pt muted and texts
18pt, each centred horizontally and vertically in a cell sized for the longest code
or text plus 4 pixels of padding; each pair is centred in its column. Every line is
40 pixels high, so columns stay level and texts line up whatever the codes' widths.
A table taller than 360 pixels scrolls; 9 lines fit, such as 48 entries in 6
columns.
The code ends at the first `:`; neither part may contain `|`. Both are trimmed,
non-empty and at most 8 characters; a table has at most 256 entries. A malformed
table shows "Unavailable:" and the reason in its place; the page still loads. It
cannot be combined with `mcText`, `mcWrap` or `mcType`, and `mcColumns` requires
it. Like every read-only row it is never saved or marked dirty. Contributors can
check their values offline with `menu_contributions.textTable(value, columns)`,
which decodes them as ModCoreSettings does and raises on malformed input. A hooks
page writes the fields into the manifest its `manifest()` returns.

`mcChoiceNotes=<value>:<text>;<value>:<text>` on a picker gives choices a note,
shown small and muted on a second line under the current choice, within DMM's
40-pixel row; the choice's label moves up to make room. Each value must be one
of the picker's `PresetValues` and appear once; the text is trimmed, cannot
contain `;` and has at most 64 characters. A choice without a note shows one
line as before. The note is presentation only: saved values are unchanged. Tab,
cycle and header-tab pickers show no notes.

Set `mcNavigation=1` on a picker to use its choices only for menu navigation.
The picker can drive ordinary `VisibleWhen` / `VisibleValues` rules, but has no
config key, never marks the menu dirty, and is omitted from Apply events. Its
selected view lasts while the menu model is open. Navigation pickers use DMM's
arrow selector unless they explicitly request another presentation.

Set `mcTabsWidth` to an integer from 160 through 440 to reserve that total
width in pixels for the horizontal choices. The default grows by option count
up to 384 pixels. A two-option `mcTabsWidth=440` picker is twice the default
220-pixel width while retaining 144 pixels for its label.

`mcLevel=0` inherits the existing font. Levels 2–6 use sizes
16, 15, 14, 12 and 11 respectively. Level2/3 use the heading color;
Level4 uses normal body text; Level5/6 use
muted text, with Level5 at 85% opacity. The property applies to setting labels
and Category headings without changing control types. A setting label at level 2
is 20pt, larger than a level-2 heading, because it names the page's main choice.
`mcLevel=1` on a setting gives it the title style, like `mcHeading=true`.

Set `mcCategory=1` on a setting to make it stand in for its group's heading. Its
label takes the Category heading's look: 16pt muted, unindented, with the
heading's spacing. While it shows, the rows after it indent beneath it as they
would under a visible heading. Pair it with `mcHeading=0` on the group so the
heading does not show twice. It cannot be combined with `mcLevel` or `mcHeading`.

Set `mcHeading=true` on a setting to use the title style. That setting shares
the mod page title row above the divider, on any page. Its setting label is
hidden while the original control retains its value and navigation. Dirty
styling is omitted from this title row. This supports toggles, pickers and
sliders; at most one setting per provider may be a heading. Your mod still
implements its settings' behavior.

Categories can declare `mcHelp` to show Level5 explanatory text under
the heading. DMM's `VisibleWhen` / `VisibleValues` rules still govern the group.

`mcLabel=<text>` on a category is its heading's text in place of the category
name, so two groups can share a heading text. `mcLabelWhen`/`mcLabels` still
take precedence while their source holds a listed value.

Set `mcHeading=0` on a category to suppress only that category's heading:

```ini
[Category.Player Actions]
mcHeading=0
```

The category remains a normal DMM group: its rows retain their manifest order,
visibility rules, navigation and Apply/Restore behavior. Any shared `mcParent`
heading remains visible while the category has visible rows. `mcHelp` is not
rendered when its category heading is suppressed. `mcHeading` accepts
`false`/`true` or `0`/`1` and defaults to `true` on categories.

Categories can also share a parent heading without flattening that heading into
each category label:

```ini
[Category.PrimaryWheel]
mcParent=Interaction: Independent
mcParentLevel=2
mcLevel=3

[Category.SecondaryWheel]
mcParent=Interaction: Independent
mcParentLevel=2
mcLevel=3

[Category.SelectiveBindings]
mcParent=Interaction: Selective
mcParentLevel=2
mcLevel=3
```

`mcParent` is the displayed parent label. Categories with the same exact
label share one parent heading and retain their own category headings as
subgroups. `mcParentLevel` accepts levels 0–6 and defaults to 2; every
category sharing a parent must use the same level. Parent headings do not add
visibility rules. A provider that wants persistent Independent and Selective
sections should leave their categories unconditional. If every subgroup under
a parent is hidden by DMM, ModCoreSettings hides the otherwise empty parent heading.

For labels that depend on another picker or toggle, settings and categories
can declare:

```ini
mcLabelWhen=PrimaryWheel
mcLabels=0:Secondary Wheel;1:Primary Wheel
```

Unlisted source values retain the original label. Category ordering is opt-in:

```ini
mcOrderWhen=PrimaryWheel
mcOrders=0:20;1:10
```

Only opted-in categories exchange positions, in ascending rank order. Other
categories remain in their original positions. Rows retain their setting IDs,
config keys and children. Reordering occurs on a relevant value change, using
DMM's existing menu refresh; no additional timer is created.

## Migrating missing defaults

`DefaultFrom=OldConfigKey` copies an existing value in the same `ConfigFile` and
explicit `ConfigSection` only when the destination key is absent. The source
must satisfy the destination range/choices and step. An invalid source prevents
initialization instead of silently overwriting it. An explicit destination value
always wins; an absent source uses the ordinary `Default`. Migration reads only
existing values, so it does not depend on setting order or follow default chains.

`DefaultFromMap=0:1;1:2` optionally converts the copied number through a finite
map. An existing source must have a mapped entry. No expressions are evaluated.

For cross-section or conditional copies, use ordered sections:

```ini
[DefaultRule.PositionFromLegacy]
Target = Position
SourceSection = Legacy Layout
SourceKey = UpperX
SourceDefault = 40
WhenAbsent = General/Role
WhenZero = Legacy Layout/Swap

[DefaultRule.PositionFallback]
Target = Position
SourceSection = Legacy Layout
SourceKey = LowerX
SourceDefault = 20
```

`Target` is a setting ID with an explicit `ConfigSection`. Rule section names
must be unique. Rules run in manifest order, at most 32 per target; the first
matching rule with an available source supplies the missing value. A rule without
`SourceDefault` is skipped when its source is absent. If no rule supplies a value,
the setting's ordinary `Default` applies. A target cannot also use `DefaultFrom`.

Both optional conditions must match. `WhenAbsent=Section/Key` tests whether the
key existed in the original file. `WhenZero=Section/Key` accepts finite integers;
zero or an absent key matches, while any nonzero integer does not. It is evaluated
only after `WhenAbsent` matches. References are exact and case-sensitive, and
read only the same configuration file's original snapshot. Explicit destination
values bypass all source and condition evaluation. Consumed source values must
satisfy the destination range, choices and step; malformed values fail instead
of being clamped or replaced. Duplicate config sections/keys are rejected.

Migration retains original bytes and unknown keys, adding only missing declared
destinations in one file transaction. This runs whenever a page with stored
settings opens, with or without migrations; for a page without them it adds
missing keys with their `Default`. A failed initialization sets DMM's normal
error state and disables editing/Apply until the problem is corrected. No DMM
source files are modified. If a crash interrupts the transaction, the next open
restores a moved-aside original and removes leftover `.mc-init.tmp`/`.mc-init.bak`
files that are provably redundant; any other leftover file is named in the page
error for you to review and delete.

## Mapped presets

ModCoreSettings expands mapped presets inside DMM's own pending model. Declare a picker with
`CustomValue`, a pipe-separated `MappedPresetTargets` list of setting IDs, and
semicolon-separated `MappedPresetValues` entries. Each entry has the form
`presetValue:targetValue|targetValue`, in target order. For example:

```ini
MappedPresetTargets=Ability1|Ability1Mode
MappedPresetValues=1:82|0;2:49|1
CustomValue=0
```

The picker must declare values `0|1|2` in this example. Every non-Custom value
needs a complete mapping. Targets may be sliders, pickers or toggles; values must
fit their declared ranges, steps or choices. Overlapping and nested presets are
rejected, including overlap with DMM's ordinary `PresetTargets`.

Selecting a preset synchronously updates all targets before DMM refreshes or
applies. Preset-derived target changes hide their dirty indicators while retaining
the actual pending/committed differences. A manual target edit selects Custom and
marks only that target against the selected preset's visual baseline. Returning
all targets to a named preset selects it automatically. Custom cannot be chosen
directly. Apply and Restore clear the visual baseline.
Apply and Restore remain DMM operations. Opening an inconsistent saved preset
preserves its keys and changes the pending picker to Custom.

## Module categories

The Settings page's Modules tab provides Group modules (Yes/No) and Preferred Category valid with # modules (No/2/3). Apply saves [Modules] GroupModules (1/0) and PreferredCategoryMinimum (0/2/3) in config.ini. Defaults are Yes and 2. The next module browser build uses the applied values.

ModCoreTemplates publishes categories per installed UE4SS mod folder. A category always remains available as fallback; mcCategory is preferred only when the required number of distinct available folders declare it. Child pages count once. No disables preferred categories; disabling grouping removes ordinary category headings. The foundation navigation remains together under ModCore. Unregistered folders and conflicting matches use Other or Specialized.
